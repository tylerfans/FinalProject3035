##code to generate bigrams and ggplots 
##first I loaded the unscrubbed corpus using the for loop in Tylerâ€™s code. Unscrubbed because I want to look at the words he and she.
###comments and ggplots are by Mika

data("stop_words")
SMART <- stop_words%>%
  filter(lexicon == "SMART")%>%
  filter(word != "he") %>%          # remember != in this context means "not equal to"
  filter(word != "she")

fem_bigrams <- fem_dataset%>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2) ##unnesting into bigrams

fem_bigrams_filtered <- fem_bigrams %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  ## "bigram" is the column to be separated
  ## "word1" and "word2" are the two new columns to be created
  ## "sep = " "" tells R to split the bigram where it finds a space
  
  filter(!word1 %in% SMART$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% SMART$word)


fem_bigrams_scrubbed <- fem_bigrams_filtered %>%
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")   ## joining everything back together with unite()


pronouns <- c("he", "she")  ##so I can filter for the words he and she and have them occupy the same collumn

fem_bigram_gender <- fem_bigrams_scrubbed %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(word1 %in% pronouns) %>%             ## this is the step where the pronouns are filtered
  count(word1, word2, wt = n, sort = TRUE)


# Now we can create a visualization to help us compare these two sets of 
# bigrams:

# First, we'll visualize for "he" words. This is done by 
# filtering word1 for only "he", finding the top 20, and plotting.

fem_bigram_gender %>%
  filter(word1 == "he") %>%
  top_n(20)%>%
  mutate(word2 = reorder(word2, n)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(word2, n) +
  geom_col(color="skyblue4", fill="cadetblue1")+
  coord_flip()

# Next we can visualize the top "she" bigrams, using the 
# same filter, but this time for "she". 

fem_bigram_gender %>%
  filter(word1 == "she") %>%
  top_n(20) %>%
  mutate(word2 = reorder(word2, n)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(word2, n) +
  geom_col(color="violetred4", fill="lightpink")+
  coord_flip()
